    """Generate control networks by randomly permuting connections while preserving network properties.

    This function creates randomized versions of the input networks while maintaining:
    - The same number of connections (for binary networks) or weight distribution (for weighted networks)
    - Symmetry (undirected graph structure)
    - No self-connections (zeros on diagonal)

    Args:
        matrices:
            Input adjacency or weight matrices with shape [*batch, num_nodes, num_nodes]

    Returns:
        Permuted control networks with the same shape as input matrices, preserving key properties

    Examples:
        >>> import torch
        >>> from gnm.utils import get_control
        >>> from gnm.defaults import get_binary_network
        >>> # Get a real network
        >>> real_network = get_binary_network()
        >>> # Generate a control with preserved properties
        >>> control_network = get_control(real_network)
        >>> # Check that control has same number of connections
        >>> real_network.sum() == control_network.sum()

    Notes:
        - For binary networks, this is equivalent to randomly rewiring all connections
        - For weighted networks, connection weights are preserved but redistributed
