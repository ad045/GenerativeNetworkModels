r"""Generative rules for determining connection affinities in network models.

This subpackage provides various generative rules that determine how nodes
in a network form connections based on different topological properties.
These rules produce affinity matrices that represent the likelihood of
connections forming between pairs of nodes.

The rules fall into several categories:

- Homophily-based rules (MatchingIndex, Neighbours): Nodes connect based on shared neighborhoods
- Clustering-based rules: Nodes connect based on clustering coefficient relationships
- Degree-based rules: Nodes connect based on node degree relationships
- Geometric rule: A baseline rule where all connections have equal affinity

Each rule produces an affinity matrix that can be used within a generative network model
to determine connection probabilities along with other factors such as distance.
