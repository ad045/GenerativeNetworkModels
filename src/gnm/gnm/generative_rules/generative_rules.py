class MatchingIndex(GenerativeRule):
    r"""Compute affinity based on shared neighborhoods between nodes.

    The matching index measures the similarity between the neighborhoods of two nodes,
    which is a form of homophily. Nodes with many common neighbors will have a high
    matching index, making them more likely to connect.

    Two calculation methods are supported:
    1. "mean" - Normalizes by the average size of the two neighborhoods
    2. "union" - Normalizes by the size of the union of the two neighborhoods

    Let $N(u)$ be the neighborhood of node $u$.

    When the divisor is set to 'mean', the matching index is computed as:
    $$
        K(u,v) = \frac{ | N(u) \cap N(v) | }{ ( |N(u) - \{v\}| + |N(v) - \{u\}| ) /2 }.
    $$

    When the divisor is set to 'union', the matching index is computed as:
    $$
        K(u,v) = \frac{ | N(u) \cap N(v) | }{  | N(u) \cup N(v) - \{u,v\}| }.
    $$

    When $N(u) - \{v\}$ and $N(v) - \{u\}$ are both empty, the matching index is zero.

    Degree-based rules use the degree (number of connections) of nodes to determine
    connection affinities. These rules can create various network structures by
    favoring connections between nodes with specific degree relationships.

    The (normalised) degree of a node $u$ is computed as:
    $$

    The division by $|V|$ (number of nodes) ensures that the degree is between 0 and 1.

    the affinity factor using different relationships between node pairs.
