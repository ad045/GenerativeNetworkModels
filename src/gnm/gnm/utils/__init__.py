r"""Utility functions for working with generative network models.

This subpackage provides various utility functions that support the core generative
network modeling functionality. It includes:

- **Statistical measures**: Functions for statistical comparisons between networks
- **Graph properties**: Various network metrics and measures for analysing graph structure
- **Data validation**: Functions to verify the validity of network data structures
- **Control networks**: Functions for generating control networks with preserved properties
- **Convert Datatypes**: Functions to convert numpy and additional datatypes to GNM-compatible tensor

These utilities handle both binary and weighted networks and are optimised
for use with PyTorch tensors.
