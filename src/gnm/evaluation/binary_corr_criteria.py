r"""Correlation-based criteria for evaluating binary networks.

This module provides evaluation criteria based on spatial correlations of network
properties between synthetic and real binary networks. These criteria quantify 
the similarity in the spatial patterns of degrees, clustering coefficients, and 
betweenness centrality, which is important for capturing the spatial organization
of brain networks.

    This criterion measures the similarity between the spatial patterns of node degrees in
    synthetic and real networks using Pearson correlation. Unlike KS statistics which
    compare distributions, correlation criteria assess whether the same nodes have
    similar relative values in both networks.
