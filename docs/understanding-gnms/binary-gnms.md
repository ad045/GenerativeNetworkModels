## The Binary Generative Network Model

The [binary generative network model](glossary.md#binary-generative-network-model) (henceforth, *GNM*) is a model which, through the iteration addition of [edge](glossary.md#edge) to a network, is able to generate networks which have significant topological similarity to real brain networks. The [nodes](glossary.md#node) in the GNM [represent individual brain regions](networks-and-graphs.md#brains-as-networks) within a [parcellation](glossary.md#parcellation). The pattern of connectivity between these regions is [represented by](networks-and-graphs.md#representing-networks) an [adjacency matrix](glossary.md#adjacency-matrix-a), $A_{ij}$.

<!-- In a standard binary GNM, [edges](glossary.md#edge) are either present or absent. If [node](glossary.md#node) $i$ is connected to [node](glossary.md#node) $j$, we set $A_{ij} = 1$. Otherwise, if [node](glossary.md#node) $i$ is not connected to [node](glossary.md#node) $j$, we set $A_{ij} = 0$. Additionally, the [edges](glossary.md#edge) are undirected, meaning that we do not assign directionality to the connections. Consequently, $i$ is [connected](glossary.md#connected) to $j$ ($A_{ij} = 1$) if and only if $j$ is [connected](glossary.md#connected) to $i$ ($A_{ji} = 1$). If $i$ and $j$ are connected by an [edge](glossary.md#edge), we say that they are [neighbours](glossary.md#neighbour). -->

The core of the GNM is very simple. The model begins with a seed [adjacency matrix](glossary.md#adjacency-matrix-a), $A_{ij}$, which can be either empty (zeros everywhere) or already contain some connections. At each step of the algorithm, we compute a likelihood that each currently unconnected pair of nodes will form a connection. We then sample a pair of nodes randomly according to this distribution. An edge is then added between the sampled nodes. This cycle then repeats, with edges being added one-by-one until one-by-one until a desired total number of connections is reached. Importantly, at each step the current pattern of connectivity present within the network influences the likelihood of connections between nodes, allowing for complex feedback loops. 

![Figure 3](figures-png/fig3.png)

Within a GNM, the [likelihood of a connection forming at each step](#computing-wiring-probabilities) depends on both the distance and affinity between the nodes. Distance captures spatial constraints on wiring, and in general the further two nodes are physically separated from each other the less likely a connection is to form between them. The influence of distance on wiring probabilities is controlled through a parameter $\eta$. Affinity captures non-spatial topological factors that influence connection formation. As discussed [below](#computing-the-affinity-matrix), there are many different methods for computing the [affinity matrix](glossary.md#affinity-matrix-k), denoted $K$, each giving rise to different growth dynamics and final network structures. The influence of affinity on wiring probabilities is controlled through a parameter $\gamma$. 

Because the sampling of edges is performed at random, GNMs are fundamentally stochastic: running the model for the same set of parameters ($\eta, \gamma$) repeatedly can result in very different final networks. In general, there is no way for us to say the probability that a particular network will be generated via the GNM under some set of parameters; instead, we typically explore model outputs by running many copies of the model for the same parameters ($\eta, \gamma$) to examine the distribution of networks the model produces for that parameter set. By comparing these distributions across different parameter pairs, we can find the set of parameters which gives produces networks which most often have the same topological properties found in real brain networks.  

<!-- For any network structure there is some non-zero probability that the model will produce that structure; however, the GNM is interesting because it has a much higher probability of producing networks which resemble -->
<!-- 
each set of parameter values specifies a [distribution](glossary.md#distribution) over possible [graphs](glossary.md#graph), meaning there is some probability of generating each particular [network](glossary.md#network) structure. While these probabilities are very difficult to measure analytically, we can explore them through simulation, running the model multiple times with the same parameters to sample from this [distribution](glossary.md#distribution).


The model is parametrised through [distance](glossary.md#distance-transform-d) and [affinity transforms](glossary.md#affinity-transform-k), which determine how the raw distance and affinity values influence [wiring probabilities](glossary.md#wiring-probabilities-p_ij). These [transforms](glossary.md#transform) can follow either [exponential](glossary.md#exponential-relationship-type) or [powerlaw](glossary.md#powerlaw-relationship-type) relationships, providing flexibility in modelling different types of dependencies. -->

### Computing Wiring Probabilities

At each step of the GNM, we must compute [wiring probabilities](glossary.md#wiring-probabilities) $P_{ij}$ that each pair of currently unconnected nodes will form a connection. We begin by computing *unnormalised* wiring probabilities using both the distance and affinity matrices, $D$ and $K$ as follows.  

The distance matrix $D$ measures the physical separation in space between nodes; $D_{ij}$ is equal to the distance between nodes $i$ and $j$. From the distance matrix, we obtain a [distance transform](glossary.md#distance-transform) $d_{ij}$ dependent on both the parameter $\eta$ and on the distance relationship type. When the distance relationship type is exponential, the distance transform is computed as $d_{ij} = \exp( \eta D_{ij} )$. When the distance relationship type is powerlaw, the distance transform is computed as $d_{ij} = D^{\eta}$. Similarly, from the [affinity matrix](glossary.md#affinity-matrix) $K_{ij}$ we obtain an [affinity transform](glossary.md#affinity-transform) $k_{ij}$ using parameter $\gamma$. When the affinity relationship type is exponential, the affinity transform is $k_{ij} = \exp( \gamma K_{ij} )$; when the affinity relationship type is powerlaw, the affinity transform is $k_{ij} = K_{ij}^\gamma$. 

To combine the geometric information contained in the [distance transform](glossary.md#distance-transform), $d_{ij}$, with the non-geometric, topological information contained in the [affinity transform](glossary.md#affinity-transform), $k_{ij}$, we multiply these together to produce unnormalised wiring probabilities, $$ \tilde{P}_{ij} = d_{ij} \times k_{ij}. $$ Several important constraints are then applied to these unnormalised probabilities. Existing [edges](glossary.md#edge) have their probabilities set to zero, since we can only add new edges between nodes not already connected. This can be accomplished by multiplying the unnormalised probabilities by $(1 - A_{ij})$, which is $0$ when $i$ and $j$ are adjacent ($A_{ij} = 1$) and $1$ when they are not currently connected ($A_{ij} = 0$). Since nodes cannot form edges to themselves (*i.e.*, self-connections are prohibited), we set the diagonal terms to $0$, $\tilde{P}_{ii} = 0$. Finally, we normalised the probabilities by dividing by their sum to ensure the sum of the normalised probabilities is $1$. 

![Figure 2](figures-png/fig2.png)

After sampling from the normalised probabilities and adding the selected connection to the [network](glossary.md#network), the process iterates. The [affinity matrix](glossary.md#affinity-matrix-k) is recomputed based on the updated [adjacency matrix](glossary.md#adjacency-matrix-a), new unnormalised and normalised [wiring probabilities](glossary.md#wiring-probabilities-p_ij) are calculated, and sampling continues. This iteration continues until the desired number of [edges](glossary.md#edge) is reached.

### Computing the Affinity Matrix

The [affinity matrix](glossary.md#affinity-matrix-k) $K_{ij}$ captures an arbitrary non-geometric factor influencing the likelihood that [nodes](glossary.md#node) form [edges](glossary.md#edge) between them, depending on the current pattern of connectivity in the network. Different [generative rules](glossary.md#generative-rule) provide various methods for computing the affinity matrix $K$ on the basis of the adjacency matrix $A$. There are three main classes of generative rules implemented within the toolbox - [degree-based rules](glossary.md#degree), [clustering-based rules](glossary.md#clustering-coefficient), and [homphily rules](glossary.md#homophily). 

Degree-based rules are built off the [degree](glossary.md#degree) of each node, $s_i$ ([defined](networks-and-graphs.md#node-level-measures) as the number of [neighbours](glossary.md#neighbour) of node $i$). The degree difference method compute $K_{ij} = |s_i - s_j|$, and thereby assigns a higher affinity to connections between nodes which currently have similar degree. The degree minimum method computes $K_{ij} = \min(s_i, s_j)$, and so assigns a higher affinity to connections into nodes which currently have a high degree. Within the degree class we also have degree maximum, average, and product methods. See the table below for definitions of these. Clustering-based rules are computed via analogous formulae, except using the clustering coefficients $c_i$ instead of the degrees. 

[Homophily](glossary.md#homophily) rules instead assign a higher affinity to conenctions between nodes that already have a similar connection profile. There are two homophily rules implemented within the toolbox: Neighbours and Matching Index. Neighbours computes the affinity as the number of neighbours shared between two nodes. Accordingly, when two nodes share a large number of neighbours, they will have a high affinity. Note that neighbours will, in general, assign a higher affinity to connections into nodes which have high degree, since having a high number of neighbours means that you will be more likely to share those neighbours with any other node. Matching Index controls for this by instead computing the affinity between $i$ and $j$ as the fraction of nodes connected to either $i$ or $j$ which are connected to *both* $i$ and $j$. See the table below for a precise definition.    

<!-- The various [generative rules](glossary.md#generative-rule) fall into several categories, each with a distinct rationale. Degree-based rules consider the connectivity of individual [nodes](glossary.md#node), with variants including maximum, minimum, difference, and sum operations applied to [node](glossary.md#node) [degrees](glossary.md#degree). Clustering-based rules incorporate local network structure by considering the [clustering coefficients](glossary.md#clustering-coefficient) of [nodes](glossary.md#node). [Homophily](glossary.md#homophily) rules favour connections between [nodes](glossary.md#node) with similar connection patterns, implementing the principle that "similarity breeds connection."

The [clustering coefficient](glossary.md#clustering-coefficient) of a [node](glossary.md#node) measures the extent to which its [neighbours](glossary.md#neighbour) are also connected to each other, quantifying local network clustering. As described in the [Networks and Graphs](networks-and-graphs.md#node-level-measures) section, this measure captures the proportion of possible triangular motifs that actually exist in a [node's](glossary.md#node) local neighbourhood. The [degree](glossary.md#degree) of a [node](glossary.md#node), as detailed in the same section, simply counts the total number of connections that [node](glossary.md#node) has.

Implementation details for these [generative rules](glossary.md#generative-rule) can be found in the [`gnm.generative_rules`](../api-reference/generative-rules.md) module, which provides a comprehensive set of rule types for binary network generation. -->
